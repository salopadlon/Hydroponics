# Hydroponics
Codes for hydroponics system data gathering and processing

Now containing just basic Arduino code.  
  
Future plans:
- Save data to database and visualise them (e.g. website, smartphone app, etc.)
- Develop automated system of environment conditions control (temperature, humidity, nutrients, etc.)
